# Palladio-Supporting-FeatureModel-DiagramEditor
Outdated: The Feature Diagram Editor has become part of the official [Eclipse EMF Feature Model project](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EMF_Feature_Model/Feature_Diagram_Editor).

Feature Diagrams are an established, graphical notation for feature models. They use a hierarchical tree structure to present features and their child features as well as their cardinality.

We have developed a Feature Diagram Editor as an Eclipse Plugin based on the EMF Feature Model and the Graphiti framework. This page lists the required resources and provides a guideline how to use the editor.
